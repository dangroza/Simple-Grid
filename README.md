# CSS Grid

CSS Grid with minimal browser support

## About
Forked from https://github.com/zachacole/Simple-Grid 

All the code you need is simple and familiar. A parent container class contains the grid. Within the container are rows. Row classes denote rows of content, which can be filled with up to 12 columns. Columns must be nested within a row. 

To define your column width, declare how many columns you want your content to take up on desktop and large screens. For example, if your content should take up 6 out of 12 columns (or half the container), your class name will be .col-6.

If you donâ€™t want columns to expand on mobile devices and small screens, simply add -sm to the end of your column class name. For example, if you want to have two blocks of content floating side-by-side on small screens, each would be given the class name .col-6-sm.
